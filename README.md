## Update
[2024/9] TOI has been accepted at NeurIPS 2024 as a poster!

## Traffic Object Importance (TOI) Dataset
### Folder Description: <br>
The object importance annotation results of TOI are located in the "annotation" folder. There are a total of 28 txt files, which correspond to the annotations of 28 videos. The filenames correspond to the raw data in the KITTI official dataset.

### To Do: <br>
To use these annotations, you need to download the Raw Data from the [KITTI](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php). The files that need to be downloaded are [synced+rectified data].
